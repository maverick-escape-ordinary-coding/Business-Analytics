# Business-Analytics
Assignment on analysis using Tableau

## Problem
Crime analysis is one of the most important activities that intelligence and law enforcement organisations perform all over the world. In this project you will analyse data that has been collected about crimes that happened in different parts of the US. The dataset consists of all related data about a crime such as where it happened, the important dates of the event and how is it co related to other events. Most law and enforcement agencies face the challenge of efficiently and accurately analysing the growing volume of crime-related data. The outcome of the project will show useful insights such as:
1. Analysing and understanding complex patterns of crimes.
2. What are the trends in the progression of crimes in certain areas?
3. What age groups are mostly involved in these incidents?
4. What weapons are used in various crimes?
5. What measures can law enforcement agencies take to reduce crime?

## Milestones
1. Initial data exploration
2. Understand the business requirements and identify stakeholders
3. Visualise the dataset to try and answer the business questions
4. Develop a narrative telling a story around the data
5. Identify recommendations for future improvements and enhancements
